Project Overview

This C++ program extracts the first and last name from a full name string input by the user. It searches for the first space in the input string and splits the string into two parts: the first name (before the space) and the last name (after the space). If no space is found, the entire input is treated as the first name, and the last name is left empty.

Features:
Handles names with and without spaces.
Uses basic string manipulation techniques (find() and substr()).
Displays the extracted first and last names to the user.
Files

Name.h: Contains the function declaration to extract first and last names.
Name.cpp: Contains the function implementation using C++ string functions.
main.cpp: The main file where the user interacts with the program and sees the results.
