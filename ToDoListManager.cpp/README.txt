Project Objective


The To-Do List Manager is a C++ console application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. This project showcases key C++ concepts such as variables, constants, control structures, functions, arrays, input/output, and the use of the standard library.


The program allows users to:

	•	Add tasks with a unique ID, name, and priority.
	•	Remove tasks by ID or name.
	•	View all tasks and their completion status.
	•	Mark tasks as completed.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming principles as outlined in the rubric for the C++ project assignment.
